# Gender-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

## Objective:
### Implementation of a deep learning model to recognize the gender of people in images. 


## Overview:

* This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network which is trained on a dataset of images labelled by gender.

* A web cam application is also implemented to capture faces off the video stream and classify them as either man or woman. 

* The classifier attained a training accuracy of 98.4% and a validation accuracy of 95.6%.



## Code and Dependancies
* **Python Version:** 3.7

* **Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, glob, scikit-learn, tensorflow, OpenCV, cvlib
